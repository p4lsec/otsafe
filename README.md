OTsafe is a Python-based framework designed to model, detect, and potentially respond to cyber-physical threats. By providing a layer of abstraction over industrial processes, OTsafe allows for a real-time cross-section of disparate data sources, ensuring the safety of personnel, equipment, and the environment. OTsafe's goal is to fill gaps in monitoring and detecting unsafe conditions at Purdue Levels 0-2. 

The beauty of OTsafe is that the tool allows you to abstract away the implementation-specific details of the control network, allowing users to focus on the functions and interaction of components.  From there, users can build detections and automation around things like the unsafe conditions, attacker TTPs, and more. 

## Overview

OTsafe aims to prevent *"control loop compromises"* - instances where components of a control loop within a control system are influenced beyond safe operating parameters, whether accidentally or maliciously.

OTsafe's core strength is its ability to model real-world systems and apply various data sources to bring these models to life. It detects unsafe, suspicious, or anomalous conditions, regardless of their cause or intent.

The three main elements of OTsafe include:

- A [core library](#core-library) that establishes common syntax for any industrial component
- An extensible framework which allows teams to model systems, connect them to live control system data, and then test and apply custom detections and responses. (Contact me if you want to collaborate on this! Need more hardware testing)
- Project implementation automation hub, provided via Jenkins. This helps you build, test, and deploy your specific implementation. 

## Use Cases

OTsafe can be applied across a variety of scenarios for bolstering the safety measures of physical processes, and ensuring that people, equipment, and environments are protected. Here are a few use cases:

- **Highly secured OT Environments**: OTsafe is ideal for organizations that operate in highly secure environments, such as critical infrastructure, where any deviation from normal operating parameters could have significant implications. OTsafe's comprehensive monitoring and control measures can help understand the safety implications of a control network.  OTsafe's ultimate goal is to detect and respond to anomalies before they cause damage.

- **Insider Threats**:  The impact of an insider threat in a control environment has already proven to be catastrophic (see [this article about a disgruntled water employee here](hhttps://www.waterisac.org/portal/updated-october-21-2021-insider-threat-â€“-former-employee-indicted-unauthorized-computer)).  OTsafe can provide protection against insider threats by operating as a tamper-proof layer of visibility and control.  

- **Safety Prioritization**: Organizations that prioritize safety and want an additional layer of controls can benefit from OTsafe. It offers a comprehensive set of tools to monitor and manage equipment, ensuring safe operation and compliance with safety standards.

- **Risk Assessment and Mitigation**: Engineers conducting Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) can leverage OTsafe to incorporate cyber risk scenarios into their assessments. By simulating potential threats and analyzing their impacts, teams can build more robust mitigation strategies.

- **Integrated Operations Centers**: For organizations that seek to ensure the safety of people, equipment, and the environment, OTsafe could serve as a technical hub for various remediation efforts. It helps connect and correlate data from disparate sources, enabling more comprehensive monitoring and response.

- **Compliance Teams**: CISOs and internal compliance teams aiming to demonstrate compliance with, and even applying an auditable layer of controls can benefit from OTsafe. It facilitates clear documentation of safety measures, providing a trail for internal and external audits.

- **Health, Safety, and Environmental (HSE) Staff**: HSE teams can use OTsafe as a crucial tool in their Process Safety Management (PSM) programs. By standardizing and indexing required data such as safe operating parameters, OTsafe can operationalize this intelligence. Furthermore, OTsafe's modeling and simulation capabilities can aid HSE staff in predicting and preventing potential safety incidents, further strengthening the organization's commitment to a proactive safety culture.

- **Data Integration**: For those working on connecting disparate data sources and capabilities, like historians, inventory management systems, detection engines, and playbooks, OTsafe provides a common platform to integrate these sources and create comprehensive views of processes.

- **Community Development**: Those interested in making a positive impact on safety practices in the industry can use OTsafe as a springboard for their ideas. With its open-source nature, OTsafe encourages contributions and collaborations.
Please note that OTsafe may not be suitable for small teams with limited resources, or in scenarios where a comprehensive safety-oriented solution is not necessary.

## Core Library

The core library of OTsafe is a Python API enabling users to model pertinent components of a cyber-physical process. It allows real-time sensor readings, emulates noisy sensors, and offers a wide array of features for realistically representing industrial components.

## Detections

Once process telemetry data is ingested, OTsafe enables the building of detections for unsafe conditions. Detections are engineered intelligently, often involving process engineers and subject matter experts (SMEs). This allows for the detection of anomalous and malicious modifications to the process.

## Automation capabilities

OTsafe utilizes Jenkins for orchestration, allowing for easy deployment, scalability, and serving as an automation platform. It enables system-wide defensive measures in the event of a disruption.

## Install

To install the core library from PyPI:

```
pip install otsafe

## Roadmap

As OTsafe continues to grow and evolve, our roadmap includes several exciting updates and features. Please find below some of the enhancements we are looking to incorporate:

- **Mapping to IEC 62443**: One of our primary roadmap items is to map the features and capabilities of OTsafe to IEC 62443, an international series of standards on "Industrial communication networks - Network and system security." The goal is to provide clear guidance on how OTsafe can assist in achieving compliance with these widely-recognized standards, thereby boosting the credibility of your cybersecurity initiatives and assuring stakeholders of the robustness of your defenses.

- **Integration with Additional Data Sources**: We plan to expand OTsafe's ability to integrate with additional data sources, enabling you to gain a more comprehensive understanding of your industrial processes and systems. This will improve anomaly detection capabilities and provide a more complete picture of your system's status.

- **Improved User Interface**: We're continuously working on enhancing the user experience and making the system more intuitive and user-friendly. This includes improvements to the dashboard, notifications system, and process modeling capabilities.

- **Advanced Detection Capabilities**: We aim to enhance OTsafe's detection engine by incorporating more sophisticated algorithms and machine learning techniques. This will allow us to better identify patterns and detect anomalies, thereby enhancing the system's ability to prevent accidents and security incidents.

- **Customization Features**: We understand that every industrial system is unique, and our aim is to allow users to customize OTsafe to best fit their needs. This includes the ability to define custom thresholds, alerts, and responses. Plans are in place to introduce default dashboards. 

- **Further Automation Capabilities**: We're planning on expanding OTsafe's automation capabilities to include more scenarios and response actions, with the aim to increase operational efficiency and speed up incident response times. Jenkins is optionally available as the project hub. Examples showing how to automate detection engineering testing/deployment via CI/CD pipelines will be included. This is a capability your SOC should seek to have!
