OTsafe is a Python-based framework designed to enhance the visibility and security of safety-critical functions in operational technology (OT) environments. It offers capabilities to model, detect, and assist in responding to cyber-physical threats, whether they arise from intentional actions or accidents.

A primary aim of OTsafe is to prevent "control loop compromises" - instances where components of a control loop within a system are influenced beyond safe operating parameters, either accidentally or maliciously. By abstracting the complexities of industrial processes, OTsafe empowers teams to model their control systems, enabling a concentrated focus on building systems that are both safe and secure.

One of OTsafe's core strengths is its ability to model real-world systems and apply various data sources to bring these models to life. Through the ingestion of resources like PCAPs, asset inventory databases, and more, it provides a real-time cross-sectional view of various data sources, detecting unsafe, suspicious, or anomalous conditions, regardless of their cause or intent. A key objective is to address the gaps in monitoring and detecting unsafe conditions, particularly at Purdue Levels 0-2.

The abstraction layer of OTsafe ensures that users can account for the unique, implementation-specific details of their control networks. This allows for a more in-depth focus on the functions and interactions of system components. Consequently, users can develop detections and automation strategies centered on aspects such as unsafe conditions, attacker TTPs, and beyond.

## Use Cases

OTsafe can be applied across a variety of scenarios for bolstering the safety measures of physical processes, and ensuring that people, equipment, and environments are protected. Here are a few use cases:

- **Highly secured OT Environments**: OTsafe is ideal for organizations that operate in highly secure environments, such as critical infrastructure, where any deviation from normal operating parameters could have significant implications. OTsafe's comprehensive monitoring and control measures can help understand the safety implications of a control network.  OTsafe's ultimate goal is to detect and respond to anomalies before they cause damage.

- **Insider Threats**:  The impact of an insider threat in a control environment has already proven to be catastrophic (see [this article about a disgruntled water employee here](hhttps://www.waterisac.org/portal/updated-october-21-2021-insider-threat-â€“-former-employee-indicted-unauthorized-computer)).  OTsafe can provide protection against insider threats by operating as a tamper-proof layer of visibility and control.

- **Accident Investigators**: Teams that are investigating industrial accidents and near-misses can use OTsafe to model the control system, allowing them to quickly and clearly see what went wrong, and when.

- **Safety Prioritization**: Organizations that prioritize safety and want an additional layer of controls can benefit from OTsafe. It offers a comprehensive set of tools to monitor and manage equipment, ensuring safe operation and compliance with safety standards.

- **Risk Assessment and Mitigation**: Engineers conducting Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) can leverage OTsafe to incorporate cyber risk scenarios into their assessments. By simulating potential threats and analyzing their impacts, teams can build more robust mitigation strategies.

- **Integrated Operations Centers**: For organizations that seek to ensure the safety of people, equipment, and the environment, OTsafe could serve as a technical hub for various remediation efforts. It helps connect and correlate data from disparate sources, enabling more comprehensive monitoring and response.

- **Compliance Teams**: CISOs and internal compliance teams aiming to demonstrate compliance with, and even applying an auditable layer of controls can benefit from OTsafe. It facilitates clear documentation of safety measures, providing a trail for internal and external audits.

- **Health, Safety, and Environmental (HSE) Staff**: HSE teams can use OTsafe as a crucial tool in their Process Safety Management (PSM) programs. By standardizing and indexing required data such as safe operating parameters, OTsafe can operationalize this intelligence. Furthermore, OTsafe's modeling and simulation capabilities can aid HSE staff in predicting and preventing potential safety incidents, further strengthening the organization's commitment to a proactive safety culture.

- **Data Integration**: For those working on connecting disparate data sources and capabilities, like historians, inventory management systems, detection engines, and playbooks, OTsafe provides a common platform to integrate these sources and create comprehensive views of processes.

- **Safety Engineering**: Team responsible for the safety engineering of systems can use OTsafe to assist in building safe, reliable procedures and environments.  This includes FMEA, FTA, and HAZOP analysis.  These realms are not typically/fully inclusive of cybersecurity-related incidents or mitigations. 

- **Community Development**: Those interested in making a positive impact on safety practices in the industry can use OTsafe as a springboard for their ideas. With its open-source nature, OTsafe encourages contributions and collaborations.
Please note that OTsafe may not be suitable for small teams with limited resources, or in scenarios where a comprehensive safety-oriented solution is not necessary.

## Components

The three main elements of OTsafe include:

- A [core library](#core-library) that establishes common syntax for any industrial component
- An extensible detection framework which allows teams to test and apply custom detections and responses. (Contact me if you want to collaborate on this! Need more hardware testing)
- Implementation automation hub, centered around Jenkins. This helps you build, test, and deploy your specific implementation. 

## Core Library

The core library of OTsafe is a Python API, enabling users to model pertinent components of a cyber-physical process. It allows real-time sensor readings, emulates noisy sensors, and offers a wide array of features for realistically representing industrial components. 

## Detections

OTsafe enables the building of detections for unsafe conditions. Detections can be built in pure Python or can be codified in YAML files (everything-as-code FTW!). 

Detections can be tested against historic data (via PCAPs), or via live process telemetry and data via a local network interface.  As always, be smart about what you connect to your control network.  Use of a data diode or span port is highly recommended.  

## Automation capabilities

OTsafe utilizes Jenkins for orchestration, allowing for easy deployment, scalability, and serving as an automation platform. It enables system-wide defensive measures in the event of a disruption.
