    "# OTsafe Jupyter Notebook Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook will demonstrate various use cases for OTsafe, an aftermarket safety/security system designed to enhance the safety of operational technology (OT) environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstration is based on a real-life incident at a marine port company in Florida. The company, which operates several cargo ship docks and large cranes for loading and unloading 20-foot and 40-foot shipping containers, experienced a significant security breach.\n",
    "\n",
    "An attacker managed to join the corporate Wi-Fi network from the parking lot and due to the flat network structure, they were able to monitor the control system network traffic for the cranes in real-time. The attacker eventually transmitted a crafted Modbus packet which caused the crane's container clamp to open while it was lifting and moving a container. As a result, the container fell to the ground, causing its contents to be destroyed. Fortunately, no personnel were injured in this incident."

    "## Control Loop Compromise\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"Control Loop Compromise\" refers to the accidental or malicious influence of one or more components of a control loop within a control system context. It is important to note that these incidents are not always malicious in nature. In fact, mechanical failures, such as a faulty valve, are often more likely to impact the control loop than a malicious attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Control loop compromises can also include accidental events. Hence, it may not be completely accurate to refer to all such incidents as \"integrity attacks.\" In this context, a control loop compromise could be considered a tactic, with an integrity attack being one of several possible techniques."
